# Sprint 1 & 2 Development Archive

**Archived**: 2025-12-11 08:00 UTC

## Purpose

This archive contains developmental artifacts from Sprint 1 & 2 of the 0rigin project, covering:
- Classical Kuramoto model implementation
- MSFT (Synchronization-Mass Field Theory) development
- Integration and validation work

These documents were archived during repository cleanup and professionalization to maintain a clean project structure while preserving the development history.

## Key Outcomes

The work documented in this archive resulted in:
1. A working implementation of the classical Kuramoto model
2. Novel MSFT field theory implementation with Hamiltonian dynamics
3. Validated energy conservation and overdamped limit behavior
4. Discovery of effective mass scaling relationship (m_eff ∝ R)
5. Comprehensive test suite with >95% coverage
