1. keep the code clean, modular, reusable - whenever possible
2. make sure tests are distinct injections of our MSFT engine
3. make sure documents and outputs are done in the correct directories with the correct subdirectory labeling
4. we want expectations, methodologies, results and summaries documented and anything that can be visualized should be visualized.
5. unless you have confirmed that the GPU code is working, use the CPU code
6. don't make redundant files, fix what we have. this should be a clean and professional academic environment
7. don't overwrite things that will be crucial for research or evidentiary in proving methodologies and results
