# Expected outcomes (from docs/SPLIT_OPERATOR_COMPLETE.md):
# - No NaN or blow-up over 50k steps
# - Norm drift < 0.1% (linear drift is acceptable, exponential is not)
# - Energy conservation < 1%
# - Operator splitting converges for N=1,10,100
# - Particle localization responds correctly to mass field m(x) = Δ·R(x)
