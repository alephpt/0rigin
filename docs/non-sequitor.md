For "particles float":

Experiment: Measure force on particle in SMFT-generated field
Prediction: F=−⟨β⟩∇(Δ⋅R)F = -\langle\beta\rangle \nabla(\Delta \cdot R)
F=−⟨β⟩∇(Δ⋅R)
Test: Does measured F match prediction within error bars?
Alternative explanations: Ruled out (EM, thermal, etc.)

For "explains spin":

Theory: Derive spin from SMFT first principles
Prediction: Gyromagnetic ratio, precession frequency
Test: Match known values (g-factor = 2.002319...)

For "EM permeation":

Theory: Couple SMFT to Maxwell equations
Prediction: Modified wave equation for E, B
Test: Compare to experiments (light bending, diffraction)

For "gravity opposition":

Experiment: Precision measurement of force on test mass
Prediction: Ftotal=−GM/r2−⟨β⟩∇mF_{\text{total}} = -GM/r^2 - \langle\beta\rangle\nabla m
Ftotal​=−GM/r2−⟨β⟩∇m
Test: Residual force matches SMFT prediction
Alternative: Ruled out (torsion balance, free-fall tests)
